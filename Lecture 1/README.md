# Lecture 1 - Introduction to Remote Sensing of Earth

This course will cover the basics of remote sensing of Earth including Multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. Participants will learn who satellite observations are captured, and how they can interpret them. 

## Homework

After this lecture, you are encouraged to review NASA Applied Sciences ARSET training for [Fundamentals of Remote Sensing](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-fundamentals-remote-sensing) and [Introduction to Synthetic Aperture Radar](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-introduction-synthetic-aperture-radar). These two courses cover these topics in more depth.
